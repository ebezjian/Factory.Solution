## üîß Setup & Requirements

### üìã Necessary Specifications

#### To run this project locally you will need:

- **ASP .NET Core :** You can check if you have .NET Core by running `dotnet --version` in the command line. If you do not have .NET Core please find more information and download [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core)
- **MySQL :**  You can download MySQL [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914) and MySQL Workbench [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484391)
- **Prefered Code Editor**


### ‚öôÔ∏è Open & Use

#### To Download:

Go to my GitHub repository here, [https://github.com/ebezjian/Factory.Solution](https://github.com/ebezjian/Factory.Solution), and click on the green 'Code' button to clone the repository, Open with GitHub Desktop OR Download the ZIP file

#### To clone (my prefered method):

1. Push the green 'Clone' button and copy the URL.
2. Open Terminal or GitBash and input the command: `git clone https://github.com/ebezjian/Factory.Solution.git`
3. To view the code, open the copied directory with Visual Studio Code or your preferred text editor by inputing the command `code .` in your terminal.


#### AppSettings:

After you have the project on your computer you will need to create a file in the root directory of the project called "appsettings.json". Add the following snippet of code to the appsettings.json file:

```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=ellie_lambert;uid=root;pwd=epicodus;"
  }
}
```
*Please note you will need to replace `epicodus` with the password you created for your MySQL server.

#### Import Database using Entity Framework Core (option 1 continued):

 - In the command line run ` cd Desktop/Factory.Solution/Factory` to navigate to the "Factory" folder. 
 - Next, run `dotnet ef database update` to generate the database. You can confirm the database was created by checking MySQL workbench.

*to make changed to the database you can run `dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName>`

#### Import Database using MySQL Workbench (option 2):

 - Open MySQL workbench and go to the navigation bar and select `Server > Data Import`. 
 - Next, select the option `Import from Self-Contained File` and confirm you have the file `ellie_lambert.sql` set to be imported (this files exists in the root directory of this project). 
 - Then, set the `Defaul Target Schema` or create a new schema and select all the the Schema Objects you want to be imported. 
 - Check that the option `Dump Structure and Data` is selected. Once you confirm you have all of the correct settings click `Start Import`.


#### Running/viewing application:

1. Once you have opened the code in your preferred text editor you will need to navigate to the 'Factory' folder (`cd Factory) in the command line and run `dotnet run` or `dotnet watch run`.
2. At this point you should be able to click on the link to the local server's url path to view the compiled project.
